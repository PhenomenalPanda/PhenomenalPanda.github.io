Togo's meditation study was duplicated in Japan, disassembled and shipped to Fredericksburg, then reassembled (without nails) by the same craftsmen who built it in Japan.The black and white stones in front of the building are supposed to represent 'balance of nature, ying, yang'.

Built on the grounds of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden from 1914 to 1915 and extensively restored in 1999 and 2000, the garden is highly acclaimed and considered the masterpiece of Japanese landscape designer Takeo Shiota (1881-1943).  It was constructed at a cost of $13,000, a gift of early BBG benefactor and trustee Alfred T. White.The layout of the garden features a combination of elements from the ancient hill-and-pond style and the more modern stroll garden.  A traditional-style viewing pavilion offers a panoramic view of the curved pond, which covers nearly half the site, against a backdrop of man-made mountains ortsukiyama.  An elaborate vermiliontoriigate modeled after the famous one at Miyajima stands in the pond and frames a Shinto shrine on the hill beyond.  The present shrine was built in 1960 to replace the original structure and it features traditional construction techniques, such as the use of wooden pins instead of nails.Next to the shrine, a naturalistic waterfall flows down into an inlet and on toward a traditional turtle island (kame-jima), symbolizing longevity, which is connected to the mainland by a high, rounded wooden drum bridge (taiko-bashi).Several lanterns of various styles grace the garden, including a snow-viewing lantern (yukimi-doro), a Kasuga lantern and an impressive ten-foot high, three-ton, 350-year-old lantern presented to New York in 1980 by its sister city, Tokyo.The garden incorporates plants traditionally used in Japanese gardens, such as Japanese irises, tree peonies, azaleas, maples and flowering cherries, as well as plants native to North America.A pleasant surprise awaits visitors to the garden\u2019s website: the Historic Image Collection contains dozens of photos of the garden during and immediately after construction, featuring shots of carpenters hewing logs, the foundations of the waterfall and the original plantings as well as scenic views and visitors.  The photos date from 1914 to 1916, the 1920s and 1930s and provide tidbits of information for those interested in garden history and construction methods.","Latitude:":40.666715,"Longitude:":-73.962223},{"Name:":"Brookside Garden","Alternate Name:":"","Address:":"1800 Glenallen Avenue","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"Wheaton","State:":"Maryland","Postal Code:":"20902","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.301.949.8230","Fax:":"","E-Mail:":"","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"","Construction Period:":"-","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"","Admission:":"","Added to JGarden:":"7/8/2000","Last Updated:":"7/8/2000","JGarden Description:":"","Latitude:":39.060013,"Longitude:":-77.039698},{"Name:":"Buddhist Church Betsuin","Alternate Name:":"","Address:":"630 North 5th Street","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"San Jose","State:":"California","Postal Code:":"95112","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.408.293.9293","Fax:":"","E-Mail:":"","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"","Contruction Date:":"1958","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"","Admission:":"","Added to JGarden:":"1/1/1999","Last Updated:":"7/8/2000","JGarden Description:":"This garden is sited on a small plot in from of the main hall of the San  Jose Buddhist Church in the heart of Nihonmachi.

Richardson and Albright-Knox Art Gallery, one of the leading modern art gallery in the nation. In Buffalo, visitors will also find the first park system in America, originally designed Frendrick Law Olmsted in 1870, whose other works include New York's Central Park, Boston Emerald Necklace Parks, Yosemite National Park, San Francisco's Parks System and the Niagara Reservation.The main park in Buffalo's historic Olmsted Parks System is Delaware Park, the focal point of the 1901 Pan American Exposition. Today, Delaware Park serves as Buffalo's primary place for citywide recreation and leisure. Both the Albright-Knox Art Gallery and the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society building are in this park. Delaware Park is an archetypal representation of America's Victorian and industrial era of the late 19th century.The Japanese Garden has become a part of the landscape at the west end of Delaware Park. The design of the garden was conceived in 1970; construction started in 1971 and it was completed in 1974. It originally represented a gesture of friendship between two sister cities, Buffalo and Kanazawa, Japan. Located on six acres along Delaware Park's Mirror Lake, it began with over 1,000 plantings, some lighting, and three small islands connected to the mainland by bridges. It is maintained by the City's Parks Department.Buffalo's artistic and architectural monuments, like Delaware Park, were constructed during the city's wealthy industrial period. As the main financial, transportation and manufacturing center of America's industrial heartland, Buffalo was able to attract this nation's greatest artists, designers, planners and architects to construct prototypical works of the period. Today, the city faces grave economic circumstances. Buffalo's urban core has decayed over the last decades. Many infrastructure necessities have been ruined or neglected, including the city's great parks system and the Japanese Garden.The City of Buffalo, in partnership with the Japanese Group of Buffalo, the Buffalo-Kanazawa Sister City Committee and Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy, is undertaking a redevelopment of its Japanese Garden to both renovate the existing Garden and enhance it, as a part of the \"Adopt-A-Park\" program. The program was initiated by the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy in 1995 and the City of Buffalo Parks Department to encourage people to make a commitment to a nearby park or playground, or one of our historic park areas, and help keep it clean and green.Garden FeaturesThe major features of the Japanese Garden Restoration Project include: a stabilization of the existing islands with new stone and replanting, a replacement of the islands with new stone and replanting, a replacement of the ornamental bridge, a restoration of the paths, a clearing of overgrown vegetation of the upper slopes, a trimming of the existing trees and shrubs, an introduction of a stone garden, a newkaresansuiwaterfall, a replanting of a major stand of Japanese cherry trees, new stone benches, and extensive plantings of trees and shrubs and more.The project has started on July 1995, the design of the Garden has accomplished cooperatively with the Japanese Garden experts at the City of Kanazawa, Japan. Construction begun in the middle of April 1996 and have complected the end of June 1996. The total cost of the beautification project of the Garden is $265,000, of which $96,000 is funded by the Commemorative Association for the Japan World Exposition (1970), Japan, as Japan World Exposition Co","A Brief History of the Japanese Garden":"","Garden Features":"","Latitude:":42.932456,"Longitude:":-78.846519},{"URL:":"http://www.botanicgardens.org","Name:":"Denver Botanic Gardens","Alternate Name:":"Shofu-en Japanese Garden; Shofuen","Address:":"1005 York Street","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"Denver","State:":"Colorado","Postal Code:":"80206-3799","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.303.331.4000","Fax:":"+1.303.370.8004","E-Mail:":"","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"Kawana Koichi","Contruction Date:":"site established 1952; construction Aug 1978; dedicated Juen 23, 1979.","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"9:00am to 5:00pm, daily","Admission:":"","Added to JGarden:":"1/1/1999","Last Updated:":"2/6/2005","Sources:":"File materials from Botanic Garden library.Sadafumi Uchiyama.","JGarden Description:":"The Shofu-en (lit. 'garden of the pine wind') is a two-acre garden designed byKawana Koichiand dedicated in August 1978. The core features of the garden are the specimen pines, collected and donated to the garden by the Denver Bonsai Club (some of whom later formed the Rocky Mountain Bonsai Society), and the large boulders, collected from the nearby Rocky Mountains.  The skeleton of the garden was built around 800 tons of rock chosen from the mountains near Golden and Loveland.  They were placed to represent mountains and cliffs by the sea.  The 125 ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa), also from the region, form the next layer of the design.  Large swaths of green turf are interrupted by deciduous trees and shrubs, usch as cutleaf weeping birch (Betula pendula; maples (Acer rubrumandA. Ginnala); redleaf Japanese barberry (Berberis thumbergi); flowering cherry (Pyrus calleryana); bugle weed (Ajuga reptans); multi-coloredIris ensata(growing along the stream); and several varieties of thyme (Anarcharisprovide seasonal color and interest.The garden is patterned on thechisen-kaiyushikitemplate (lit. pond and stroll garden).  A walking path meanders through the garden around a central pond with several points of interest interrupting the walk.  Three small islands in the pond represent the usual crane (the largest), tortoise and treasure ship, symbols found in many gardens of this type.There are five stone lanterns, each of them emphasizing a specific view.  The largest and most significant is ayukimi-doroor 'snow-viewing lantern' located near the pond and donated by Denver's sister city, Takayama-shi as a symbol of goodwill and friendship. A second Katsuga style lantern was donated by Takayama in 1964 and was 200 years old at the time.  The other lanterns are on the eastern pathway, at the tea house and near the wisteria arbor (anoribe-doro).A wisteria arbor (two vines, white and lavender, donated by Takayama in fall 1981) is located in the nortwest corner of the garden.  It was placed here as a stopping point along the path.  A square-shapedkesagatawater basin is also located nearby.  It is a replica of the water basin atGinkakuji, in Kyoto.  A tea house is located in the opposite, northeast corner.  It was built by the Kumo Construction Company from Nagano-ken, Japan.  The building was built in Japan, disassembled, numbered, shipped and reassembled in Denver.  Hirabayashi Toshitame, President of the company, and eight Japanese co-workers built the structure in about two weeks.  The cost of the teahouse was covered by a grant from the Weckbaugh Trusts.  The slope of the roof mirrors the sweep of the pine branches and the parallel lines were apparently indended to emphasize the other straight lines of fences, walls and hedges.  A second water basin is arranged as atsukubainear the tea house to provide the ritual hand rinsing prior to the tea ceremony.  A final features is ataikobashior drum bridge near a section of the pond.The garden is screened from the other parts of the botanic garden by scrims of bamboo fencing on the north, west and east sides.  The garden has two entrances and the scenes unfold quite differently depending on which direction one takes.The full botanic garden is quite extensive, covering a 22 acre site.  It  includes a conservatory, greenhouse, visitor's center, gift shop, restaurant, reception area and meetings room.  The garden does host weddings and conferences.  Other gardens include: rose, herb, rock, xeriscape, high plains, alpine, and lilacs.In 2002,Sadafumi Uchiyamawas recommended as project designer for a renovation of the 35-year old garden.

The project, inspired by DuPont's Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, PA, began in 1959 and required a five-year process of experimentation and design to achieve a series of landscapes replicating various classic garden settings from around the world. Duke remained personally involved with the gardens until the mid 1980s, but they have been run by the foundation since her death in 1993.The Japanese section includes a small teahouse, a wood bridge, fuji, azaleas, primrose, crocus; as well as akaresansuidry garden.One-hour tours of the greenhouse display gardens are offered Wednesday through Sunday from September through May, rain or shine.Tours run regularly throughout the day from 10:40 a.m. until approximately 3:15 p.m. with 15 people or less per group.Located on Route 206, 1 3/4 miles south of the Somerville traffic circle.Food, drinks or photography are not allowed in the gardens.","Latitude:":40.547667,"Longitude:":-74.614503},{"URL:":"http://www.csulb.edu/~jgarden/main.html","Name:":"Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden","Alternate Name:":"","Address:":"1250 Bellflower BlvdCalifornia State University","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"Long Beach","State:":"California","Postal Code:":"90804","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.562.985.8885","Fax:":"","E-Mail:":"jschelin@csulb.edu","Contact:":"Jeanette Schelin","Designer(s):":"Edward R.

The first of the three islands composing the 17.3 acre Malott Japanese Garden is Keiunto (Island of Auspicious Cloud), the largest and highest. In this island's dry garden, gravel represents water and plants symbolize land. On Keiunto, mounds of azaleas cover an entire hillside and are particularly striking when they are in bloom. Shoin House a retreat house of the Edo period, features a moss garden with kesa pattern carved water basin, pond views, and presentations by docents a couple of days a week. Check for the docents' schedule. The second island, Seifuto (Island of Clear, Pure Breezes) is named for the gentle winds that refresh the island. Seifuto features wooded spaces and tranquil views of the other two islands. The third island, Horaijima, beckons from afar and can be appreciated only from a distance. It is the Island of Everlasting Happiness, representing a paradise inaccessible to mere mortals.\r\nDr. Koichi Kawana designed this garden in the kaiyu-shiki, or promenade style developed in Japan in the 17th century. Visitors follow curving paths, a form that allows the garden to reveal itself slowly.Throughout spring and summer, Sansho-en is a lush and beautiful space that uses many shades of green with punctuations of blooms, said senior horticulturist Benjamin Carroll. The autumn color is also very vibrant.  Many visitors admire the garden's softness, silhouettes, and shadows after a winter snow.The entire Chicago Botanic Garden is 385-acres with more than 26 different gardens and several educational greenhouses of interest to all members of the family. Narrated tram tours available. A cafe, gift shop, and ask a Master Gardener service are available in the Visitor Center.","Other Description:":"Construction: A Japanese garden was included in the original plans for the Chicago Botanic Garden. Work began on Sansho-en in the early 1970s to design and build the islands. In the late 1970s and early 1980s the planting was completed. Shoin House and other structures were built and the garden was dedicated in September 1982.In 2006, the Japanese Garden and the Shoin House were rededicated in honor of Elizabeth Hubert Malott who endowed the ongoing operations of this garden.","Latitude:":42.1488,"Longitude:":-87.7756},{"Name:":"Enchanted Crest Bed and Breakfast","Alternate Name:":"","Address:":"RR #1, Box 216","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"Belle Rive","State:":"Illinois","Postal Code:":"62810","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.618.736.2647","Fax:":"","E-Mail:":"","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"","Construction Period:":"-","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"","Admission:":"","Added to JGarden:":"7/8/2000","Last Updated:":"3/30/2001","JGarden Description:":"","Latitude:":38.192698,"Longitude:":-88.759947},{"URL:":"http://www.japanesegardenmobile.org/","Name:":"Ernest and Mary Fenollosa Japanese Garden","Alternate Name:":"Japanese Garden of Mobile","Address:":"Forest Hill Drive","Mailing Address:":"Japanese Garden Foundation, Inc., P.

This new garden will be associated with Ernest and Mary Fenollosa, the art historians who received the highest award ever presented to a foreigner by the Emperor of Japan for their contribution to Japanese art history.  It will be located on the site of a former fish hatchery, fed by a freshwater spring.Mobile has a sister-city relationship with Ichihara-shi in Chiba-ken and this is playing a part in the development of the garden.Ernest F. Fenellosa (1853-1908) made contributions to the development of higher education in Japan as well as research on and preservation of cultural properties during his employment as a civil servant with the national government (1878-1890).  Back in North America, Fenellosa and later, his wife, worked to introduce and propagate Japanese art and culture to Americans.  When he left Japan for the first time in 1890, he was given the Order of the Sacred Mirror (his fourth decoration by the Japanese government and the highest honor ever given to a foreigner) by the Emperor and charged with continuing his work in the United States.  He subsequently worked for the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.  In 1895, he married Mary McNeil who had also gone to Boston to work at the MFA.  In 1896, they went to Japan to lecture and study religion, sociology, Noh theatre and Chinese and Japanese poetry.  They remained there until 1900.  Mary was enormously homesick and used this to write her first novel \"Truth Dexter\", a great success for a first novel and a passionate invocation of her homeland in Mobile, Alabama.  When they returned to the U.S., they established a home in Mobile calledKobonata(Little Sunshine).  Professor Fenollosa continued to travel throught the U.S. and Europe, lecturing and doing research on the arts.  He died suddenly on September 21, 1908 while on a trip to London.  Prior to his death, he had completed a first draft of a book calledEpochs of Chinese and Japanese Art.  It had not yet been submitted to a publisher because much editing and fact checks remained to be done.  Mary picked up in the manuscript after his death and typed the scattered notes and then in 1910, returned to Japan to meet with his former colleagues, made the necessary corrections and additions.  The book was published in 1912 and remains one of the best early surveys of pre-20th century East Asian art.Fenellosa's grave is at Homyo-in in Otsu and there is a memorial at the Tokyo University of Art, which he helped found.  There are few such memorials to Fenellosa in the U.S. and the Fenollosa Hall planned at the Japanese Garden of Mobile will be a historical and cultural continuation of his legacy.  Without the Fenellosa's efforts, a great deal of Japan's artistic and cultural patrimony would have been lost as the shogunate crumbled in 1868.  Mary Fenollosa was from Mobile, and the original site of the Fenollosa's retirement estate (Kobonata) overlooks the proposed site for the Japanese Garden.The Japanese Garden Foundation, Inc., a not-for-profit (501)(C)(3) organization, was chartered on July 25, 1995 for the purpose of developing a Japanese public garden in the City of Mobile. The Foundation is governed by a ten member volunteer board, which includes the Mayor, City of Mobile, the Honorary Counsel General of Japan, and professionals in the fields of law, finance, banking, corporate business and representatives of the community of culture and the arts of Japan.Takeo Uesugi, Ph.Ddesigned the garden and Hayahiko Takase designed the Shoin-style architecture on the site.  The garden is expected to cost US$7.2 million.","Latitude:":30.711092,"Longitude:":-88.152008},{"URL:":"http://www.ppfv.org/fabyan.htm","Name:":"Fabyan Villa Museum","Alternate Name:":"","Address:":"Routes 31 and 25","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"Geneva","State:":"Illinois","Postal Code:":"60134","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.630.232.4811","Fax:":"","E-Mail:":"FabyanVilla@aol.com","Contact:":"Diana L.

This woodland habitat is home to hundreds of natural and exotic plant and animal species and is nestled near one of the nation's oldest and most intimate national parks.The 210-acre site that is now Garvan Woodland Gardens was purchased by Arthur B. Cook in 1920.  His daughter, Verna C. Garvan, began transforming 30 acres of the property into a garden by adding rare plants to the existing vegetation.  With Warren Bankson, she cut paths through the forest and continued adding new plants.  In 1985, she donated the entire site to the University of Arkansas Department of Landscape Architecture.

They lie on a superb eighteen acre site nestled in the verdant hills of Saratoga.The Hakone gardens were originally developed by Oliver and Isabel Stine, who purchased the site in 1915 in order to build a summer retreat.  The 1915 Pan-Pacific Exhibition inspired Isabel Stine to travel to Japan for ideas.  The garden was named after the Fuji-Hakone National Park, one of her favorite places.The Stines retained Tsunematsu Shintani of Wakayama (1877-1921) to design the Moon Viewing House and Naoharu Aihara (1870-1941) to do the gardens.  Aihara was descended from a line of Imperial gardens based Koyobashi, Tokyo.The garden is sits on a hillside with a view of Silicon Valley (then knonas the \"Valley of Heart's Delight\").  The overall design approach called for an Upper House and Lower House with a hill and pond garden weaving them together.  The work was done in thesansoor country villa style popular in the late Edo period.  The Upper House, with its dramatic views, was aligned for moon viewing and was finished in 1917.  It is designed as a rustic, shoin style teahouse with a study andtokonoma.  The Lower House was completed in 1922.  It is somewhat more elaborate with redwood frame and wood siding.All of the garden and achitectural elements were constructed to the highest standards.  The Ms. Stine brought the finest craftsmen from Japan and this remains an outstanding example of Meiji era garden art.The property was sold to Major C.L. Tilden, an East Bay financier, in 1932.  His only contribution was the addition of a large main gate to the gardens.  Through the war and subsequent years, the garden was not maintained at the same level and by 1966 had fallen into a state of neglect.  The City of Saratoga rescued it from subdivision and hired Tanso Ishihara, a Kyoto garden builder, to restore the garden.  He added some new elements, such as the Camelia garden and trails.  He repaired the pond, waterfalls and pathway, and heavily pruned the garden.  In collaboration with Kiyoshi Yasui, the architect fo the Imperial Household Agency responsible for the restoration of Katsura, he created a master plan for expanding the gardens to fill the entire 18-acre site.Ishihara died in an accident in 1980, ending his opportunity to implement the master plan.  Friends in Japan and the United States, however, formed a team to see the plan fulfilled.  Yasui, in particular, was instrumental in the formation of the Japan Bamboo Society and a Sister City relationship between Saratoga and Muko, Yasui's home town.  Since then, the Bamboo Park [Kizuna-En] (1987), the Cultural Exchange Center (1990) and the tea plantation (1995) have been completed.  In 1991 a reproduction of a 19th century Kyoto tea merchant's home and shop was added to the site. This structure was built in Japan using traditional methods and tools (no nails), disassembled and reconstructed on site by visiting artisans from Japan. This building contains a tea museum, a traditional tea service area, and is used for cultural and artistic events, weddings, and business meetings.   A student that had studied with Ishihara in Kyoto, Jack Tomlinson, was appointed Japanese Garden Specialist and has overseen the maintenance of the garden in the years since.Many of the more mature plants at Hakone -- the Japanese Maples, Hinoki Cypress, Black Pines and other conifers -- were part of the original plants imported from Japan in 1915-1917 by Mr. N. Aihara, the designer of Hakone, who was employed the Stines. The large speciman Oaks, Madrone, California Laurel and Redwoods were on the property and utilized in the design of the Garden.

The twenty-five acre estate is in the heart of Washington, D.C. and includes twelve acres of estate and thirteen acres of woodlands with important azalea (3,000 specimens) and orchid (1,600 specimens) collections.According to the Hillwood Museum's web site, Myaida's garden at Hillwood is one of the last remaining examples of gardens influenced by the reintroduction of the Japanese culture to America during the 1950s. Shogo J. Myaida was a garden designer who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in the 1920s during the first wave of Japanese cultural influence in North America. Myaida was known for a style of garden design that married the best of American pragmatism and Japanese aesthetics.Myaida's goal was not to design a mimetic copy of a garden in Japan, but rather to create a 'Japanese-influenced' garden that fulfilled the requirements set by the owner. Despite his lack of obsession with authenticity, the layout of the Hillwood garden nonetheless interprets a traditional hill and pond garden with a miniaturization of a mountain landscape including a stream cascading from an evergreen forest and then pouring into a series of ponds connected by streams and waterfalls before it ends in a lake at the bottom. More than 500 stones have been placed construct a mountainous landscape.  Paths cross through the garden and wood or stone bridges are interspersed to allow movement across the water elements.  Other elements include pagodas, stone lanterns and statuary placed as the object to important views in the garden. Vegetation includes:cryptomeria,flowering cherries, azaleas and rhododendrons,Japanese maples, and pines.

Since the appearance of Commodore Perry's black ships in Japan in 1868, small amounts of information about Japanese culture began to trickle out to the rest of the world.  In continental Europe, Japanese painting, textiles, prints, design and architecture had a profound impact in the worlds of art and design, culminating in the Japonisme movement near the end of the century.  The Impressionists, Tolouse Latrec, Klimt and the other Art Nouveau artists in Austria and Paris, and numerous others experienced profound shifts in their thinking when they encountered what was, for them, a fresh new culture from Asia.\r\n\r\nThe cultural influence was felt much more gradually on the other side of the Atlantic.  But by early in the 20th Century, there had been several international expositions in Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco and St. Louis.  Each of these expos had Japanese pavilions and gardens at which the Americans marveled.\r\n\r\nSeveral significant books also appeared in America at the end of the 19th century or early in the new century, stirring the national imagination.  Edwin Morse publishedJapanese Homes and their Surroundingsin 1886.  This book influenced two Pasadena architects, Greene and Greene, to create a new aesthetic of architectural structure related to the landscape that had enormous impact on the architectural style of southern California. Josiah Conder's book,Japanese Gardening in Japan, published in 1893, was also enormously influential.As a result of these contact and several other factors, Japanese gardens became the height of fashion in Los Angeles, for those who could afford them.  Many were small tea gardens, but in the Los Angeles area, two were built before 1910 that were the size of a large estate.  One was  by Myron Hunt, Huntington's own architect.  A second was by George T. Marsh, proprietor of the famouse tea garden at the 1894 San Francisco exposition.  When he returned to Pasadena, he decided to build a commercial tea garden in Pasadena.  The effort was extravagent and Marsh spared no expense.Thus, by 1910, Huntington and Hertrich had two local examples, all of the work being done by Greene and Greene and some books on the subject. (An original copy of the Conder book was found in Hertrich's library).  They began to get ideas of their own for a Japanese garden on the grounds of the Huntington estate.  It's not clear, but there may have been some other motivations as well.  Huntington seemed to be in a great hurry to get the garden built by 1912, when he occupied the residence.  It is possible that he may have intended the garden as a gift for his bride and second wife, Arabella, whom he married in 1913.In any case, Huntington and Hertrich set about looking for a site.  They settled on a small, former reservoir, overgrown with brush, on the west side of the San Marino Ranch.  Huntington went to see Marsh, the proprietor of the Pasadena tea garden, about buying some plant material.  It was a fortuitous inquiry for both of them.  Marsh's commercial garden venture was failing financially.  Huntington, who by this time had already bought entire estates and libraries, offered to purchase the whole garden.  Marsh accepted quickly.  In 1911, Huntington started a massive earth-moving effort, shifting the entire Marsh site to the chosen reservoir site. This required dismantling Marsh's Japanese-style house, balling plants, stone and ornaments and then reassembling the entire palette.  Hertrich designed and supervised construction of the whole affair.  In addition to what was acquired from Marsh, he hired Japanese craftsmen to build a bridge and pavilion for a huge bronze temple bell.

It is now run by a private foundation.  The garden is a fascinating combination of Chinese, Japanese and American influences.Innisfree is a melange of influences.  The name is Gaelic.  Its design is a mix of Asian, Egyptian and Roman.  It was created by a Quaker.Inspired by Yeats lyric, Innisfree was established in 1930 as the private garden of Walter Beck and his wife, Marion, heiress to a Minnesota mining fortune. The Becks took the name for the garden from the William Butler Yeats poem beginning, \"I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree.\"Innisfree Garden comprises a 180-acre basin                 \r\nof 'naturalized' gardens and woodland surrounding a         \r\npicturesque lake.  Walter Beck, the garden's creator, was   \r\na student of Asian art.  Inspired by the scroll paintings of eighth-century Chinese poet and painter Wang Wei's garden, beginning  in 1930 he worked for 22 years           \r\nstaking out streams, walkways and plantings.  The           \r\nterraces, retaining walls, sculptural groupings of          \r\nnatural rock, waterfalls and planned vistas of the lake     \r\nwere organized to keep elements 'in tension,' or 'in        \r\nmotion.'\"  Beck's design organized the garden into several separate, self-contained landscapes.After Beck's death, Collins continued the work on the garden.  Following the practical directives of theSakuteiki(also known as theSensai Hishoor Secret Garden Book)  Collins incorporated Beck's individual gardens into a larger design that allows the visitor to move gracefully from one scene to the next. By the time he died in 1993, he had doubled the size of an already vast and elaborate private garden that required the services of 20 full-time gardeners, while converting it into a public garden that could be maintained by a staff of five.  While this garden was inspired by Asian art, it has a distinctly North American character.  The plants are entirely native and the stone was taken from the surrounding forest.The Garden was given to the Innisfree Foundation in 1959. In 1960, Innnisfree was opened to the public, as provided for by the Beck's will.  The site is now managed by Petronella Collins, president of the Innisfree Foundation.  Collins is the widow of Lester Collins, the landscape architect who principally designed the gardens and worked there for 40 years.

The City of Houston donated the land and helped with the construction. It is a symbol of friendship between this country and Japan.This particular garden is a daimyo style, and includes a tea garden, a kaiyushiki stroll garden, and a scroll garden. The entry garden is a dry landscape garden. Imagine you are standing on the sea (black moonstone) and the boulders are the rising landscape of Japan. The bamboo flowing in the wind represents the sound of the ocean. The boulders were moved from a former Japanese garden at the downtown Houston Lighting & Power building downtown.Entrance to the garden is through the gatehouse ornagayamon. A gatehouse at one time was used for living quarters or storage, but here it is used for other purposes, - ticket booth utility room and rest rooms.Through the gate straight ahead there is a welcoming lantern, a gift from the city of Chiba, Japan. This five-piece lantern was carved from solid granite. The aperture of the lantern focuses the spirit of the garden. There are three stone lanterns,ishi-doro, in this garden.Curved pathways in the garden are covered with crushed stone similar to moonstone. The arbor is a place to sit, meditate and clear the mind of other thoughts. It is also special place to wait until called to tea ceremony in the teahouse. Across the pond, one can see the yukimi lantern given by Houston's sister city - Chiba. Imagine that it is a lighthouse placed on a stone beach, with the pond as an ocean and the rocks in the water symbolizing ships being guided by the lantern. The cascade or waterfall makes one think of melting snow from a mountain stream. The hill is landscaped in cherry-blossom-pink crape myrtles, which bloom in the summer. Crape myrtle trees, which originated in China and Japan, are common in Houston. The stones are of Texas pink granite from Marble Falls near Austin.Leaving the arbor, proceed to the right along the flat stones through the tea garden gate or niwakido. Before entering the teahouse, tea ceremony guests walk along this path which the host will have moistened to appear damp with morning dew. This path is hence called the dewy path or roji.The tsukubai, at the end of the dewy path is used to purify oneself before going into the teahouse. This tsukubai arrangement includes the water basin, three flat rocks surrounding it and a bamboo dipper to dip water from the water basin. A beautiful sound is created when water falls through the small stones into the mizukoto or water harp below.Near the teahouse are two viewing stones. When the teahouse is open and one stands on these viewing stones to look through the teahouse, one can see a living picture of the waterfall with the distant pine trees creating a borrowed landscape or shakkei. This living picture resembles a Japanese woodblock print or ukiyoe. It is important to note, the teahouse was placed first and the garden view was then created around it.This teahouse was donated by the Commemorative Association of the World Expo Fund of Japan with the initiative of former Prime Minister Kaifu who visited Houston in 1990 for the World Economic Summit. It was built in Japan and reassembled here by Japanese craftsmen. The teahouse is made from hinoki, or Japanese cypress beams. Hinoki is famous for its smooth, fine grain and is an essential element in Japanese wooden construction. Inside, the crossbeams, which support the ceiling, are made of a special Japanese red cedar tree called Kitayama-sugi from Kyoto, Japan. This wood is carefully cultivated so knots do not develop.

Since then it has weathered many changes, including the banishment to internment camps in 1942 of the family who had given the garden to the city and cared for it since its creation.  It is the oldest Japanese-style garden in the United States.The five-acre stroll garden contains a rather eclectic collection of sub-gardens, buildings and artifacts, many with fascinating stories.  Some of its prominent features are a high drum bridge (taiko-bashi), a five-story red pagoda, a dry landscape garden (karesansui), a chain of ponds, a teahouse, a large bronze Buddha (cast in 1790 and presented to the garden by S.&G. Gump Company in 1949) and numerous lanterns and other fixtures.Several people were involved in the design and construction of the original garden, but the most credit is certainly due to Baron Hagiwara Makoto, a prominent Japanese landscape designer who lived at, built, bankrolled and cared for the site from 1895 until his death in 1925.  His son-in-law, daughter and grandchildren continued in his footsteps until 1942.A very sad chapter in the history of the garden ensued, with its caretakers evicted and name changed to the more politically acceptable \u201cOriental Tea Garden.\u201d  Many of the structures built and owned by the Hagiwaras were destroyed, one important building was downgraded to a gift shop, and Baron Hagiwara\u2019s Shinto Shrine was removed.  Some incongruity was introduced at this time when a Buddhist pagoda was moved into the shrine enclosure so that the Shintotoriigate faces the pagoda instead of a shrine, as it should.After the war the garden was eventually renamed \u201cJapanese Tea Garden\u201d and various improvements were undertaken, including the addition in 1953 of the 9,000-pound Lantern of Peace, donated on behalf of the children of Japan, and the construction of the Zen Garden by Sakurai Nagao.  Mr. Sakurai was also commissioned to redesign the entire pond area in front of the teahouse in 1960.Another major redevelopment began in 1965 when a large collection of dwarf trees, lanterns and stones originally belonging to the Hagiwaras was returned to the garden.  The Hagiwaras had entrusted the items to a friend when they were interned in 1942.  Many other projects followed in the ensuing years, including a new landscape with Mt. Fuji as the main theme which was designed by E.J. Schuster in 1979, and the restoration of three aging gates by Kawata Kensuke, one of Japan\u2019s leading temple and shrine builders, in 1985.  The garden has also been the recipient of numerous gifts of statuary and artifacts.Hagiwara Makoto and his family were finally honored in 1974 with the erection of a large stone and bronze plaque designed and made by sculptress Ruth Asawa.  The San Francisco Recreation & Park Department, which has maintained the garden since 1942, named the road bordering the garden Hagiwara Tea Garden Drive in 1986 to further honor the garden\u2019s original benefactors.Theweb site for Golden Gate Parkincludes a 360 degree panorama of the garden.BibliographyBrown, Kendall H. \"Rashomon: the multiple histories of the Japanese Tea Garden at Golden Gate Park\".Studies in the History of Gardens and Designed Landscapes. vol 18 no 2 (April-June 1998), pp 93-119.Ishihara Tanso and Wickham, Gloria.The Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park 1893-1942.

The teahouse was reassembled in the Greatwoods Hope Ranch lemon orchard. The ranch was sold in 1958 to the John H. Esbenshade family. It was later sold again in 1996. The new owners were not interested in maintaining it, but Alice Esbenshade Burke, who had studied tea in Kyoto in the 1970\ufffds, wanted to see the old building preserved. It was initially offered to the Santa Barbara Museum of Art. In 1998, with the help of the Santa Barbara-Toba Sister City Organization, the Ms. Esbenshade arranged for the donation of the teahouse to the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, where it is being preserved for future generations. \nWhile the original plan was to move the teahouse intact to its new location, the prospect of moving it through a narrow valley made this impossible. Norifumi Hashibe, a South Pasadena architect, was retained to perform the restoration that would become necessary if the building was going to be broken down. The entire building was disassembled, numbered and transported to Los Angeles for cleaning and inspection. Hashibe discovered that while the workmanship was of outstanding quality, poor quality materials had been used in hidden parts of the structure. This is not surprising given the resource limitations of post-War Japan. The Coats article even describes how old Mitsui family household records were used to line the fusuma panels. A decision was made to retain as much as possible of the aged wood, but replace items that had deteriorated. New hinoki was ordered to replace the damaged portions. The roof was the next source of trouble. It was agreed by the advisory committee that the roof should be replaced with a thatched reed roof. Hashibe felt that this steeper angle to the roofline would fit in the new site location. California officials were concerned this would be fire hazard, so specially treated fire retardant miscanthus reeds were shipped from Japan and new roof attached in 2001. The local residents, however, became concerned that a thatched roof in a fire-prone location. The SBBG CEO, Ed Schneider made the difficult decision to have the new roof removed and replaced with asphalt shingles. The area around the site was redesigned as a garden. Specimen trees were retained, the dry wash was re-contoured and nearby rock was left in place. A small waterfall was added, but water and noise concerns have restricted its use.\n\nThe sukiya-style teahouse has three rooms: a 4.5-mat main tea room with tokonoma and entryway; a 3-mat waiting room; and a preparation room. It is a very traditional design with bamboo and cedar strip ceiling, fusuma, amado, and shojiscreens, plaster walls, and a thatched roof. This arrangement places the teahouse as a cross between the rustic soan style of Sen no Rikyu (1522-1591) and the more elaborate shoin style promoted by Kobori Enshu (1579-1647). The teahouse was named ShinKanAn (lit. look through the heart) by the Urasenke Tea School. The teahouse has been nestled into a roji based on native California plants. A stone bridge divides an inner garden uchi roji from the outer garden soto roji. Other landmarks include a tsukubai, manzanita, Port Orford cedar, coffeeberry, Island redberry and madrone plantings. A key objective of the Botanic garden is preservation of these native California plants. The Coats article points out that the teahouses presence in a botanic garden dedicated to California native species is rather strange.

The garden was begun in 1960 upon the return of Ambassador and Mrs. Humes from Japan.  They became interested in Japanese gardens, and over the following four years, engaged the services of a Japanese garden designer and his wife.  The garden was given to the Wild Life Sanctuary in 1980 by Ambassador Humes, and his Foundation was started for the purposes of maintenance and preservation.  Upon his death, Ambassador Humes left the garden to the Foundation and the garden opened to the public in 1987.   The Garden Conservancy assumed care, management and preservation in 1993.  The local  Long Island Community has been providing volunteers to assist in maintenance, visitor services and special events.  The garden is one of few northeast examples of traditional Japanese garden design.The garden is a combination of several design concepts and immediately evokes (quite successfully)  the sensation of yamazato,  the transcendent feeling of a deep, remote mountain hamlet.   These design concepts  are conditions that were common of, and quite mandatory  for Japanese garden and landscape design.  There is a scenic representation\r\nof a lake garden (without an 'island') which contains  a water condition dating far back into Heian imperial design (circa 790) in the 'bottle gourd' traditional configuration.  The lake garden is  authentically replicated on a plateau of land midway through the garden, at a point approximately midway up the elevation.  The lake is also pleasantly viewed from the windows of  thecha-shitsu(tea house), so participants in wabi-cha (tea ceremony)  will have meditative surroundings. The house was brought to America by Ambassador Humes and is characteristic of the\r\nshoin-dzukuri form set forth in the Ashikaga period (1300's).  This house is the largest and dominant architectural form within the garden, recessed behind specimen plantings of evergreens, bamboos, and the famed 'tortoise' planting of shrub and rocks (symbolizing longevity)- a very essential element of imperial garden design, as well as an essential element of the calligraphic art of the old masters.  The water of the lake garden religiously evoked a principle tenet of Zen Buddhism:\r\nparadise or eternity was a water garden and was the heavenly abode of Amida (a very benevolent deity).  Along therojiare severalyatsuhashi, which are plank bridges and although these were originally functional, they serve as more transitional spaces within the garden.  Entering from the guests entrance, one passes over theyari-mizu(drawn stream) which winds its way into the garden and the pond.  Aesthetics characteristic of Japanese garden and landscape design relate directly to the Buddhist and Shinto elements of beauty: appreciation of age; impermanence;\r\nimperfection; perishability; simplicity; irregularity; incompleteness: understatement: and mystery.The Japanese stroll gardens have been found in history dating back centuries, and the design elements are extremely different when compared to Western gardens.  There are very specific principles governing all gardens in Japan, be they small tsuboniwa (courtyards), monastic retreats or residential properties, and some of the grander imperial gardens still exist in towns such as Kyoto and Nara.  The primary element of Japanese garden design is symbology, for the garden is a compilation of metaphors based in the religions of Shintoism and Buddhism, where the gods inhabit nature.  The garden was designed to compress the sensory qualities of the natural world into a small space  of land, in most cases, no more than a few hectares.

Kubota was a horticultural pioneer who began combining Japanese design techniques with North American materials in his display garden in 1927. The resulting site is in a spectacular setting of hills and valleys, interlaced with streams, waterfalls, ponds, bridges, and rock outcroppings with a rich array of plant material.Kubota arrived in the U.S. from Shikoku in 1907.  The Kubota Gardening Company was established in 1923 and went on to become a successful enterprise, with a garden on the Seattle University campus and the Japanese garden at theBloedel Reserveas only two of the most famous examples.The garden started as a much smaller (5 acre) swampy site in the Rainier Beach neighborhood.  It grew with the business to its current size.  It was the family home, the business office, the nursery and a showcase for the company's techniques.  A stream that naturally flowed through the site was enclosed in a pool and planted in the 1930's.  The garden and home was abandoned in the 1940's when the Kubota family was forced to relocate to Camp Minidoka in Idaho, one of several Japanese internment camps during World War II.  After the war, Kubota worked with his two sons, Tak and Tom to rebuild the business and expand the nursery.  In the 1960's 400 tons of stone were added to the site, increasing the opportunities for new landscape features.Kubota Fujitaro passed way in 1973 at age 94, shortly after he had been awarded with the Fifth Class Order of the Sacred Treasure by the government of Japan for his contributions to Japanese gardening in the U.S.  Later in the 1970's, the site Kubota had built became a target for condominium developers.  Local community groups rallied to have the core 4.5 acre garden declared an historic landmark and succeeded in 1981, when the City of Seattle Landmarks Preservation Board protected it.  The property was acquired by the City of Seattle in 1987 from the Kubota family.  More recently, the City's Open Space Program also purchased the seventeen acres surrounding the garden to remain as a natural area.  The garden is now maintained by the City of Seattle's Department of Parks and Recreation.The garden received a new entrance gate, designed by Gerard Tsutakawa, and wall in 2004.  An entrance garden was designed byKobayashi Koichiand constructed by attendees of the 4th International Symposium on Japanese Gardens in August 2004.The Kubota Garden Foundation was established as a membership-based 'friends' organization in 1989.  The Foundation offers additional support to the garden in the form of additional funding, volunteer work, publications and public tours.  To schedule a guided tour, call the Foundation at 206.725.5060.  Volunteers gather to work on the garden every third Saturday from April to October, 8am - noon.  Call the Kubota Garden Senior Gardener at 206.684.4584 to volunteer at other times.The Parks and Recreation Department permits weddings and other events to be held at the garden.

Dooley acquired a former dairy farm on the James River in what was then Henrico County. From rough fields and pastures, they created a showplace of the type in vogue among the American millionaires of the Gilded Age. Completion of their opulent mansion in 1893 was only the beginning, and throughout the next three decades, the Dooleys continued to develop the grounds of their estate. Maymont today includes many attractions, but for many, the greatest pleasure of Maymont is the expansive 100-acre tract of parkland and gardens, still very much as the Dooleys left it.With high bluffs, massive rock outcroppings, streams and ravines, Maymont\ud066 dramatic fall-line terrain provided an excellent palette for the creation of an eclectic style landscape of the type in fashion for country estates such as Maymont at the turn of the century. Wealthy, well-traveled Victorians, like the Dooleys, expressed their enthusiasm for historical design, for exotic cultures and for nature through the architecture, furnishings and the elaborate landscapes of their estates. At Maymont, rolling lawns in the English park style form a naturalistic backdrop connecting the major components of the landscape.For lovers of horticulture, garden design and architectural history, Maymont is appreciated as an unusually complete and significant example of an American country place of the Gilded Age, a distinctive estate on the grand scale for which luxurious landscaping was an essential part.Maymont\ud066 Japanese Garden is a blend of several different styles of Japanese gardens and two distinct periods of design. In 1911, the Dooleys purchased a wedge-shaped section of the Kanawha Canal that bordered Maymont. To create their garden, they hired Muto, a master Japanese gardener who had designed gardens for other estates along the East Coast. \r\nThe original garden encompassed a much smaller area than the garden today. Over the years after the death of Mrs. Dooley, the garden gradually lost much of its original splendor and detail. In 1978, the garden was renovated by Barry Starke of Earth Design. From Muto\ud066 original design, stonework around the base of the waterfall, several trees and the winding watercourse that leads to the large pond remain. Through federal grants and the ongoing support of Ikebana of Richmond, the garden has evolved over the years to include traditional elements of a Japanese stroll garden, one which offers the visitor changing impressions of nature as the various areas come into view. Carefully pruned trees and shrubs, raked sand pools, stone groupings and water features are intended to create the affect of an old, naturally developed landscape. The pond is populated with Koi, Japanese goldfish of the carp family. A grant from the William B. Thalhimer Foundation and Family supported the completion of the renovation.The site includes trained and pruned trees and shrubs, raked sand pools, stone groupings and multiple water areas -- all designed to create the impression of an old, naturally developed landscape. Design elements include stone lanterns, paths and bridges. Green, brown and gray colors are emphasized to represent the ruggedness of natural scenery. Flowers are used discreetly. Water iris bloom along the water\ud066 edge in spring, followed by the floating blooms of the water lily in summer.One of the most recent additions to the Garden is the northern entrance gate, a traditional archway. Other new refinements include additional plantings by the pond, three new lanterns and a new pathway along the pond. These and other renovations have been made possible through the ongoing support of Ikebana of Richmond, federal grants and the William B. Thalhimer and Family Foundation.A Japanese Garden Guide is available at Maymont which provides interpretive information, blending horticulture, history and Japanese symbolism to enrich your appreciation of<","Latitude:":37.533357,"Longitude:":-77.474757},{"URL:":"http://web.mit.edu/warnick/www/house.html","Name:":"MEITEC US-Japan Friendship House","Alternate Name:":"","Address:":"","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"Cambridge","State:":"Massachusetts","Postal Code:":"02138","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.617.868.6050","Fax:":"","E-Mail:":"warnick@mit.edu","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"Shinichiro Abe, ZEN Associates","Contruction Date:":"1990","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"By appointment","Admission:":"","Added to JGarden:":"4/3/2001","Last Updated:":"4/3/2001","JGarden Description:":"The MEITEC US-Japan Friendship House is a three-story Victorian house offering an intimate setting for discussions between scholars, artists, scientists, and opinion leaders who share the common goal of improving US-Japan relations.

There are 9 demonstration gardens to show how great looking landscapes can be created in even the most stubborn landscapes. Assortments of wildflowers, a Japanese garden, and perennials round out the beautiful gardens of the facility.The Minnesota Landscape Arboretum was founded to find plants that would tolerate the frigid -35\u00b0F winter weather of Minnesota. Landscape materials and winter hardy fruit development were required by the Minnesota Legislature act that established the arboretum. The goals of the arboretum are: a.) to develop winter hardy plant material; b.) to provide extension and University education; c.) to develop a program for children to study plants; and d.) to show and inspire the public about the value of landscape plants.The arboretum is part of the University of Minnesota and administered through the Horticulture Department. The budget is over $4 million a year with 1/3 from the University; 1/3 from gate fees and revenues produced at the arboretum; and 1/3 as gifts and donations. There are 15 permanent staff members, 100 summer employees and 600 volunteers that give tours, do weeding and clerical assistance.Fruit research began around the turn of this century at a farm near the edge of the present arboretum.  Today, there are winter hardy fruits of almost every kind except peaches growing here.  Landscaping plants research began soon after World War II. At the present time there are 935 acres of land at the arboretum and horticulture research center where the fruits are being grown. The fruit shade tree plantings began in 1958.The Japanese garden is one of three in the twin cities region. There is also a home demonstration garden where nine different landscapes are illustrated. These include: a rock garden, a deck garden, a cut flower garden, a container garden, a garden for small spaces, an herb garden, a garden for outdoor living, a fruit and vegetable garden, a naturalistic garden, and an AllAmerican trial garden. The peony garden contains 150 new varieties. The rose garden has over 200 varieties of Tea Roses. Since roses die at 20\u00b0F, the \"Minnesota tip method\" was developed to keep the plants alive. Other areas of the arboretum include an Azalea garden, sugar maples, prairie wildflower display, shade tree display, a ginkgo collection, a maple grove, lindens, a weeping tree collection, crabapples, a small tree collection, a spruce collection, a  pine collection containing over 100 varieties, several ash trees are growing, and there is an elm collection.Gift ShopOffers books in horticulture and related subjects, unique cards and graphics, and special Arboretum and Minnesota gift items to make your visit memorable.Tea RoomDaily serves hearty cafeteria-style lunches with homemade soups, gourmet salads and great freshly baked desserts.

This exceptional cultural site was made possible by George Morikami and is owned and operated by the Palm Beach County Department of Parks and Recreation.  At the beginning of the 20th century, Morikami left Miyazu, Japan with a group of fellow emigrants to establish a farming colony called Yamato in Boca Raton, Florida.  The community did not survive, but Morikami remained in Florida as a farmer and businessperson.  In 1977 he bequeathed 200 acres of land to Palm Beach County and the State of Florida to honor his fellow colonists and both their original and adopted homelands.Today, the Museum includes both permanent and changing exhibitions on Japan and related cultural topics, the Yamato-kan villa, sculptures, bonsai collections, gardens, pavilions, cafe, museum store, the Donald B. Gordon Memorial Library, IBM Infotronic Gallery, annual festivals and nature trails.  Performances and film series are held in a 225-seat theatre.  Tea ceremonies are held in a dedicated tea house,Seishin-an.  The institution also sponsors classes and workshops inorigami,bonsai,ikebana,haiku,sumi-epainting, orchid cultivation, Japanese language, photography, kite-making and other topics.Phase OnePhase One of the garden included the Yamato-kan pavilion, an historicishidorostone lantern, atsukubai(water basin), bonsai display, Allen S. Austin Memorial Waterfall (designed by Carn Reid), akame shima(turtle island), a Challenger Memorial Lantern, Yamato Island, the Morikami Falls, the Wisdom Ring, a dry creek garden and part of the seven-acre lake.  Phase One was completed in December 1999 and opened shortly thereafter.The Yamato-kan, located on Yamato Island, was the original site of the Morikami Museum building but now houses an exhibit on the colony of Japanese farmers for which it is named.  It is designed to give visitors a sense of the size and layout of a traditional Japanese farm house.Theishidorolantern was originally erected in 1681 at Toshogu Shrine in Edo as a memorial to Ietsuna, the fourth Tokugawa shogun.  It was later moved to a shipbuilding company in Kure and then later to a ship owner in West Palm Beach.  From there it found its way to the South Florida Science Museum and finally to the Morikami in 1977.The Challenger Memorial was dedicated to the seven Challenger astronauts, one of whom was Ellison Onizuka, the first person of Asian descent to travel into space.  The Kasuga-style stone lantern is on the northwestern tip of Yamato Island.The Wisdom Ring  is located west of the current main museum building.  It is a replica of a stone lantern (ishidoro) located in Delray Beach's sister city in Japan, Miyazu, where it is the town symbol.  The original Wisdom Ring (chie no wa) stands on the grounds of a temple dedicated to Monju, the Buddhist bodhisattva of wisdom.  This replica was given to the Museum by the citizens of Miyazu to commemorate the institution's 20th anniversary in 1997.Phase TwoThe Morikami Museum and Gardens opened the second phase of its Japanese gardens on January 9, 2001.  The six new gardens had been under construction for the previous 18 months and opened with events that included taiko drumming, origami, calligraphy, bonsai, ikebana and tea ceremonies.  Officially now known as the George D. and Harriet W. Cornell Gardens, the $3.5 million project covers 16 of the site's 200 acres and is now one of the largest Japanese-inspired gardens in the world.The new gardens, designed by Hoichi Kurisu, are intended to represent six periods of Japanese garden history.

She had been left an inheritance by her mother who had also built Japanese gardens in New Orleans and Rancho Santa Fe.  After visiting the gardens of Kyoto, she decided to use the inheritanc eto build her own garden.  The garden master, Saito Katsuo, then 92, was visiting California at the time.  He asked her to write down her reasons for wanting him to do the design as well as how the garden would subsequently be used.  In her essay, Teasdel pledged to share the private garden with others and credits this promise with Saito's agreement to do the work.Teasdel's garden has three sections: a stroll garden, a meditation garden and a tea garden (roji).  Teasdel uses the tea house to practice ikebana and to hold tea ceremonies for guests.  The garden also has several unconventional elements, however.  The swimming pool is what separates it from Saito's 400 other gardens.  The pool won a gold medal from the National Swimming Pool in 1989.  It's moss-covered rock edges, diving rock and turtle island with akuromatsupine in the center make it a unique site.  The garden also includes a spa and koi pond. Another innovation was the integration of computer controls for the lighting, cleaning and waterfalls that feed the  pool and attached koi pond.Teasdel did more than write checks for the project.  She personally selected all of the 210 tons of local stone from a quarry in the Sutter Buttes (known as the world's smallest mountain range).  She even flew out to Los Angeles to rent a truck and drive back 60 bags of Mexican black stones, the delayed arrival of which had threatened to derail the project.  Her well-thumbed copy of Saito's bookMagic of Trees and Stoneshas been a guide throughout the process.After the stone skeleton of the garden was in place, the second phase began.  This consisted of the construction of a teahouse orchateiand required 75 craftspeople to complete. The third phase was the addition of akaresansuimeditation garden just outside the fence that surrounds the main garden.  This area also includes a grouping of stones with a 6ft black pine (kuromatsu) that welcomes the visitor into the garden.Teasdel describes the garden as aspiring toshibui.  According to her, Saito wanted \"people to feel the unity of the rocks and water, and all the trees and plants. Unity is the principle of why I build these gardens all over the world. Friendship, and the feeling that we are one people, is what I express in these gardens.","Latitude:":38.743134,"Longitude:":-121.184989},{"Name:":"Mytoi Japanese Garden","Alternate Name:":"","Address:":"Chappaquiddick IslandDyke Bridge Road","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"Edgartown","State:":"Massachusetts","Postal Code:":"02539","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"","Fax:":"","E-Mail:":"","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"","Construction Period:":"-","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"","Admission:":"","Added to JGarden:":"2/1/1999","Last Updated:":"3/30/2001","JGarden Description:":"This garden features 14 acres of Japanese maple, holly and sweet gum and flowering shrubs, such as azalea, rhododendron and wild roses.

Wood structures salvaged from the Kintai Bridge's bi-century reconstruction project will be formed into a smaller bridge structure and placed in the NBI Japanese garden as an expression of harmony between Japan and the USA. The bridge was delivered and assembled at the garden site by a group of carpenters traveling from Iwakuni City to Everett in summer 2003.  (The head carpenter is the 11th generation of the family who were specialized in construction of the Kintai Bridge that was originally built in 1673.)Over $350,000 has been raised and pledged through private donations, grants, and other gifts for the design, construction, and maintenance of the garden. The project is managed through the NBI and evcc Foundation, with valuable assistance from the NBI garden advisory committee. Zen Landscape & Design and Sukiya Home Inc. will construct the major garden features, including a water feature and garden gate and wall. The project was opened in June 2004.From the NBI:Since 1987 the Nippon Business Institute Japanese Cultural and Resource Center has been a program department of Everett Community College in Everett, Washington.  The primary mission of the NBI is to help \"Bridge the Cultural Gap\" which exists between eastern and western cultures.  With our mission in mind, we promote the study of language, history, culture, social structure, economic issues, communication styles, and business protocols.  We also facilitate a wide array of interactions between local businesses and Japanese companies, as well as between members of our community and their Japanese friends and associates.The NBI Japanese Cultural and Resource Center is a new facility, providing a home, from which we are able to conduct our programs.  Initial funding for the center was provided by the Commemorative Association for the Japan World Exposition (1970)along with many generous private individuals, groups, organizations and companies.  Designed by architect Kazuyuki Murata, the Center's construction has occurred in two phases.  Phase I construction was completed in May 1997; Phase II was completed in October 1999.The NBI Japanese Cultural Center's amenities include: administrative offices, student computer labs which house computers capable of both Japanese and English language functions, meeting space, a demonstration kitchen, a small library of Japanese books that can be checked out, a Japanese tatami room for tea ceremony instruction, and classrooms.The garden has been the third and final phase of the project.","From the NBI:":"","Latitude:":48.005496,"Longitude:":-122.206589},{"URL:":"http://sites.communitylink.org/nbg/","Name:":"Norfolk Botanical Garden","Alternate Name:":"","Address:":"Azalea Garden Road","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"Norfolk","State:":"Virginia","Postal Code:":"23518","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.757.441.5830","Fax:":"+1.757.853.8294","E-Mail:":"","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"","Contruction Date:":"1962 (restored in 1995)","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"Daily, 8:30 am to sunset","Admission:":"Adults $2.50, Children 5 and under, free, Seniors, $1.50","Added to JGarden:":"4/3/2001","Last Updated:":"4/3/2001","JGarden Description:":"Bordered on three sides by the waters of Lake Whitehurst, Norfolk Botanical Garden represents an mosaic of many gardens covering 155 acres.

These world's fairs occured every few years in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and were enormously influential events for the history of art and design as well as for exposing Americans to a range of cultural influences and potential trade partners.  Japan was just emerging on the international stage as an important world power, and it was the first foreign government to commit support to the Columbian Exposition in Chicago.  It gave $500,000 to the Fair and built a replica of thePhoenix Hall (Byodoin) in Ujion Jackson Park's Wooded Island (near the site of the Fair).  This structure, then known as 'Ho-o-den', along with some minor landscape elements, became the core of what is now called the Osaka Garden.The area nearby was re-developed as the 'Japanese Garden' in 1934 as part of the Century of Progress World's Fair.  A tea house, built as part of the garden, was moved to Wooded Island shortly after the end of the Fair.  The Park District also constructed a peninsula, added a Shinto-style gate (torii) and enclosed the site, giving it a more private, garden-like atmosphere.  The Phoenix Hall replica was destroyed by fire in 1944, but the garden continued to be maintained.  The Park District renovated the garden in 1981 and added a waterfall.  The name was changed to 'Osaka Garden' in 1992, to honor Chicago's Sister City.  At that time, the City of Osaka donated $250,000 for some renovations to the garden, including a new entrance gate, built in 1995 byOkumura Designs.Like most Japanese gardens in North America, this is a melange of many influences, including elements of stroll, tea and pond gardens.  The site has ostensibly been layed out as a stroll garden, alternately hiding and revealing its elements as one walks through it.  The visitor enters through the new gate and follows a stone path leading to the tea house (which survived the 1944 fire).  Along the way, one finds meandering streams, the waterfall composition added in 1981 and a small turtle island (kame-shima).  The color scheme is relatively subtle with various shades of green becoming the canvas for the rest of the garden elements.A master plan for repairs and renovation of the garden was prepared in 2001 bySadafumi Uchiyama.  Phase I construction took place in summer 2002 and the garden was officially re-opened in fall 2002.  The Phase I work included reconstruction of th waterfall, pond and lagoon shorelines ($400,000).  The remaining work has continued since then and include: re-alignment of the path system; new plantings; re-construction of tea house; addition of a new tea garden; addition of pavilion at edge of the Lagoon; and construction of new entrance gate (the current one is at the tail end of the garden).This entire area of Chicago has a great deal to offer.  The garden site lies near the Lake Michigan shore and is just a few minutes walk from the Museum of Science and Industry (MSI), the University of Chicago and the DuSable Museum of African-American History.The Garden is now managed by a consortium of partners including The Chicago Park District, \r\nChicago Sister Cities International Program, \r\nThe Chicago Botanic Garden, \r\nThe Master Gardeners Program of the University of Illinois Cooperative Extension, \r\nThe Museum of Science and Industry, and \r\nFriends of the Parks","Latitude:":41.7924,"Longitude:":-87.5798},{"URL:":"http://www.pacificu.edu/","Name:":"Pacific University","Alternate Name:":"Walter Residence Hall","Address:":"2043 College Way","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"Forest Grove","State:":"Oregon","Postal Code:":"97116","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.503.352.2225","Fax:":"","E-Mail:":"","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"","Construction Period:":"-","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"","Admission:":"","Added to JGarden:":"2/3/2002","Last Updated:":"2/3/2002","JGarden Description:":"Lies behind Walter Residence Hall, designed to be viewed by student residents.","Latitude:":45.520119,"Longitude:":-123.11098},{"URL:":"http://www.pagodahotel.com/","Name:":"Pagoda Hotel Honolulu","Alternate Name:":"","Address:":"1525 Rycroft St","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"Honolulu","State:":"Hawaii","Postal Code:":"96814","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.800.367.6060","Fax:":"","E-Mail:":"","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"","Construction Period:":"-","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"","Admission:":"","Added to JGarden:":"8/26/2003","Last Updated:":"8/26/2003","JGarden Description:":"The 360-room Pagoda Hotel is celebrated locally and internationally for the value of its accommodations, its convenient location in the heart of Honolulu, just 2 miles from Waikiki, and the spectacular ponds of Koi fish inhabiting the ponds that surround the award-winning Pagoda Floating Restaurant.The hotel has two swimming pools and comprises two towers, with a number of rooms that can comfortably accommodate families up to 6 persons.

Hance Park in central Phoenix, the garden is easily accessible from all parts of the Valley.  This recently completed sister-city garden lies on 3.5 acres with a 0.8 acre pond in the middle.  It is vegetated with more than 50 varieties of plants that can withstand the rigors of a desert environment.  1,500 tons of rock were handpicked from quarries near Jerome, Superior, Congress and Florence to line the stream beds, walking paths, lakeshore and main lake waterfall.Himeji became a Phoenix sister city in November 1976 and is one of nine sister cities. Phoenix and Himeji participate in business, governmental, cultural and educational exchanges that promote international goodwill and understanding. The Garden is very much a shared cultural vision of the cities of Phoenix and Himeji.  Landscape architects from Himeji, Japan made 60 trips to Phoenix and City of Phoenix delegations made 5 trips to Himeji since 1987. Overall, more than 50 architects from Himeji, the sister-city, contributed to the project.  The Garden combined the knowledge and skills of both teams to create an authentic Japanese stroll garden that is adapted to the demands of a desert environment.  The total construction cost was $3.8 million by bond funds and an additional $1.0 million from private donations. The name Ro Ho En is a combination of three Japanese words. 'Ro' means Heron, a bird symbol of Himeji City. Shira Sagi Jou, or the White Heron, is a 300-year-old medieval castle in Himeji. 'Ho' is the Japanese word for the Phoenix bird. 'En' means garden.The Garden was made possible partially through funding provided through a Cultural Bond Election, overwhelmingly approved by Phoenix voters in 1988. The bond funds, which became available in 1998, covered only a part of the cost of building the Garden. A volunteer committee of Valley residents worked to raise the additional funding through private individual, corporate and group donations. The committee's goal was to raise one million dollars. The Garden is a city of Phoenix park and all donations are tax-deductible, but you should consult your own tax advisor. In addition to monetary gifts, there may be appropriate in-kind donations including materials and services.

At that time, Rose Hills was called Whittier Heights Memorial Park and served as the local burial grounds for Whittier. Not long after the park's founding, cemetery management realized that more land was needed and purchased an additional 100 acres. However, the community the cemetery served was growing so rapidly that the additional acreage was not adequate to meet the needs of the densely populated Los Angeles and Orange County areas.In 1928, the management launched an expansion program designed to increase the size of the cemetery through a series of land acquisitions. The program, continuing into the 1950s, increased Rose Hills' land holdings to its present size of approximately 2,500 acres. During this time, the cemetery's directors felt a name change was needed in order to better represent the expanded region the cemetery served. A community-wide contest was held in order to find the most appropriate name, and Rose Hills was selected.Moving MountainsEven with an organized plan for expansion, the going was not always easy. The largest obstacle in the path of Rose Hills' progress was the redesigning of huge amounts of land so that the expansion plan could go forward.Much of the land purchased for the program consisted of rugged hillsides, steep cliffs, and deep canyons. In order to utilize what was considered worthless property, the management of Rose Hills launched one the of the largest private land redevelopment projects ever undertaken.To reshape the terrain into gently sloping hillsides, approximately 25 million cubic yards of earth had to be moved and contoured. By the time the land conversion project was completed, Rose Hills redesigned an amount of earth about one-sixth the size of the Panama Canal.From the 605 Freeway, exit at Rose Hills Road. Travel east to Workman Mill Road, then left to the Rose Hills Memorial Park entrance.","The Early Years":"","Moving Mountains":"","Latitude:":34.01689,"Longitude:":-118.041507},{"Name:":"Rotary Gardens, Rath Environmental Center","Alternate Name:":"","Address:":"1455 Palmer Drive","Mailing Address:":"PO Box 8023","City:":"Janesville","State:":"Wisconsin","Postal Code:":"53545","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.608.752.3885","Fax:":"","E-Mail:":"","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"","Construction Period:":"-","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"","Admission:":"","Added to JGarden:":"7/8/2000","Last Updated:":"7/8/2000","JGarden Description:":"","Latitude:":42.671263,"Longitude:":-89.001962},{"URL:":"http://www.sabot.org/","Name:":"San Antonio Botanical Center","Alternate Name:":"","Address:":"555 Funston Place","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"San Antonio","State:":"Texas","Postal Code:":"78209","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.210.821.5115","Fax:":"+1.210.820.3528","E-Mail:":"","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"","Contruction Date:":"1980","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"Daily 9 am to 6 pm; November - February open 8am to 5 pm; Closed Christmas and New Years Days.","Admission:":"Adult $4, Seniors & Military $2, Child $1; Group Tour rate (20 or more): Adult $3, Child .50","Added to JGarden:":"3/7/2000","Last Updated:":"4/3/2001","JGarden Description:":"33 acres with a variety of gardens.","Latitude:":29.457405,"Longitude:":-98.459252},{"URL:":"http://www.niwa.org/","Name:":"San Diego Japanese Friendship Garden","Alternate Name:":"Balboa Park","Address:":"2125 Park Boulevard, Balboa Park","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"San Diego","State:":"California","Postal Code:":"92101-4792","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.619.232.2721","Fax:":"+1.619.232.0917","E-Mail:":"jfgsd@niwa.org","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"Uesugi Takeo, Nakajima Ken, Consolidated Garden Research","Construction Period:":"-","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"Tues - Sun, 10am - 4pm","Admission:":"","Added to JGarden:":"1/1/1996","Last Updated:":"10/16/2001","JGarden Description:":"The Japanese Friendship Garden Society of San Diego has its roots in the 1915 World Exposition.

Ben Nakamura let the Shinzen Friendship Garden Committee, seeking support form the local Japanese-American community as well as from Japan.Paul Saito, a landscape architect in Los Angeles, and Nakagawa Shiro, a teahouse designer from Japan, were selected to do the design work.  The designs were completed in 1974 and ground was broken the following year.  Extensive land sculpting was necessary with 30,000 cubic yards of earth and 600 tons of granite moved ont he site.  The design includes streams, waterfalls, seven bridges, a koi pond, extensive plantings, and pathways.  The design concept involved breaking the garden into four sections, one for each season with appropriate plantings clustered in each.The work required several years and the garden was not completed until 1981.  The original garden committee was incorporated as a non-profit organization (Shinzen Garden Committee) with the City of Fresno owning the site and responsible for its maintenance.  The teahouse plan was executed in 1989.  It was built in Japan and re-assembled by Japanese carpenters on the shore of the pond.  Over the years, several other improvements and additions have been made including: shelters, an iron fence, a pond deck, signage, anazumayaand a pathway.  The work continues and the garden committee has extensive plans for the future.The garden holds several annual events including a spring blossom festival,toro nagashi, running race, culture fair and artist events.","Latitude:":36.79,"Longitude:":-119.7905},{"Name:":"Shiojiri Niwa","Alternate Name:":"Merrifield Park","Address:":"1000 E Mishawaka Ave","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"Mishawaka","State:":"Indiana","Postal Code:":"46544","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.219.258.1664","Fax:":"","E-Mail:":"","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"","Construction Period:":"-","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"","Admission:":"","Added to JGarden:":"7/8/2000","Last Updated:":"6/26/2005","Sources:":"","JGarden Description:":"Result of friendship between Mishawaka and its sister city, Shiojiri, Japan.","Latitude:":41.66613,"Longitude:":-86.166764},{"URL:":"http://www.shofuso.com/","Name:":"Shofuso: Pine Breeze Villa","Alternate Name:":"Japanese House and Garden","Address:":"Fairmount Park Horticultural CenterNorth Horticultural Drive","Mailing Address:":"c/o Ohio House, 4700 States Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19131","City:":"Philadelphia","State:":"Pennsylvania","Postal Code:":"19103-0224","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"+1.215.878.5097","Fax:":"","E-Mail:":"info@shofuso.com","Contact:":"Tanya Yang, Site Manager","Designer(s):":"Sano Tansai (house designed by Yoshimura Junzou)","Contruction Date:":"1958","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"May - OctoberClosed MondayTuesday through Friday, 10am-4pmSaturday and Sunday, 11am-5pmAnd by appointment for groups of 10 or more.","Admission:":"Adults: $4.00; Students, Seniors: $3.00; Children under 6 and members: free.

The gate was transported to the United States for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exhibition in St. Louis and then moved to Philadephia in 1905. It was destroyed by fire in 1955.The Japanese House was built in Nagoya, Japan in 1953. The entire building, designed by Yoshimura Junzou, was presented to the Museum of Modern Art New York by the America-Japan Society of Tokyo for an exhibition held in 1954-55. After its stint in the MoMA courtyard, it was given to the City of Philadelphia and later reassembled at the current site in 1958.  The garden was designed in conjunction with the re-assembly by Sano Tansai.To honor the U.S. Bicentennial, the Japanese government made a grant in 1976 to the City of Philadelphia for extensive repairs to the house and garden. The Friends of the Japanese House and Garden was organized in 1982 to continue the preservation of the site. Repairs and renovations have continued since then as funding becomes available. The most recent funding effort allowed the hinoki roof on the building to be restored.For more details on the history of the garden, there's a reallygreat article by Christeen Taniguchi .The Pine Breeze Villa is located on the grounds of the Horticulture Center, in West Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, near the intersection of Belmont Avenue and Montgomery Drive.By automobile, take the Montgomery Drive exit from I-76 (the Schuylkill Expressway), turn west on Montgomery and take the first left; pass through the gate and follow Horticultural Drive around the greenhouses to the Japanese House.

To amend the soil, 5,000 carloads of loam were brought to Georgian Court from neighboring Monmouth County.The arboretum was established in 1989 to maintain and expand the existing gardens, which include an Italian garden, a more formal garden, and a sunken garden in addition to the Japanese one.

However, it remains in the JGarden database for its age, the quality of its maintenance, the light it sheds on the motivations behind the construction of such gardens in the early 20th century and for the intriguing way in which it has been adapted to meet the needs of the local community.The Society of the Four Arts was founded in 1936 by a group of Palm Beach residents who perceived a need for cultural institutions that had heretofore been absent from the community, and it remains today the premier arts organization in a community that now boasts several museums, libraries and other public arts groups.  It was founded in the middle of the Great Depression to encourage the appreciation of art music, theatre and literature by mounting of exhibitions; hosting concerts, lectures and film; and the establishment of a public lending library.  The original building was designed by local architect, Maurice Fatio and now houses the Four Arts Library.  It is now just one among several structures that occupy two city blocks.  The gardens adjoin this library building in a walled space that is bordered by Royal Palm Way and Four Arts Square.  Other attractions on the Four Arts grounds include a Gallery building that hosts art exhibits, lectures and films; a sculpture;  and a palm-lined mall centered on a Noguchi sculpture.The Four Arts Gardens were built in 1938 as demonstration gardens to display the diversity of landscape possibilities available to homeowners in the tropical climate of South Florida.  The seven Four Arts members responsible for creating these gardens were also members of the Palm Beach Garden Club.  The constructed Tropical Fruit; Chinese (Mrs. Lorenzo Woodhouse); Fragrant Moonlight; Spanish Patio; British Colonial; Florida Jungle; and Formal Rose gardens.  Each themed garden is accented with an appropriate facade or statuary to indicate the architectural style with which it was intended to be watched.  The gardens are arranged into interlocking courtyards with the Chinese Garden being the most prominent.In 1954 landscape architect, Richard K. Webel prepared a master plan that substantially altered teh intent of the gardens.  Over the next several years, the separate parts of the garden were gradually replanted to weave together a single, larger garden.  This remained the case until the 1990's when the Four Arts made a decision to return to the original intent of small demonstration gardens to assist local homeowners with their own garden design projects.  The gardens have therefore reversed their trend toward integration to some extent, though this remains a relatively mature tropical garden that highlights a plethora of specimen plants.  It is a quiet place, appropriate for its location next to a library and offers several pleasant reading benches.  The Chinese and 'Jungle' gardens are the most interesting.  The former is dominated by a stone-line pond a fountain bisected by a stone bridge and stocked withkoi.  The latter is perhaps the most 'Japanese' in appearance with stone paths and isolation from the other, more open courtyards.  The whole site in filled with interesting specimens including: bamboo, palms, phylodenddron, bromeliads and huge 'sausage tree' (Kigelia pinnate) from Africa.While there, I was told by some Palm Beach locals that the gardens and library were recently threatened by construction of a shopping mall.  Local residents objected, and the site is safe, at least for now.The gardens are located about five minutes from I-95.  Take the Okeechobee Blvd East exit (52A) toward Palm Beach.

The garden is designed for four-season enjoyment and includes plantings of azaleas, cherry trees, magnolias, wisteria, iris and lotus.The designer of this garden, the lateKawana Koichi, said the main theme of the garden is to show the public how reclaimed water can be used.  Located directly adjacent to a $75 million wastewater treatment plant which generates 65 million gallons of reclaimed water each day, this garden certainly proves its point.  The garden is available for a fee for weddings and other private gatherings.Los Angeles City Engineer Donald C. Tillman was responsible for the original concept of a combination wastewater treatment facility and garden, and he continued to lobby for funds to build the garden when that part of the project was shelved after the treatment plant had been completed.  The City of Los Angeles finally allocated $3 million for the project in 1979, and the garden was built from 1980 to 1983 and dedicated in 1984.

They designed and constructed a Japanese garden on the school grounds as a tribute to the Japanese-American students from the high school removed from their homes and interned during World War II.  The story became even more interesting when it was discovered that a Japanese garden had been planted by Japanese-American students on the same site over 50 years before.As part of the process of creating the garden and a curriculum that emphasizes service learning, the students researched the history of the internment.  They contacted some of the Japanese-American students who had created the original garden, asking for advice, stories and design information.  The new garden was planted on the same site as the original, which had been destroyed by members of the community after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  The project grew to include students, Japanese-American alumna and members of the community, all contributing time and money to the project.The garden was dedicated on May 6, 1996 as part of a ceremony granting honorary high school diplomas to the Japanese-American students interned before they could graduate.

The garden was constructed in 1995, with further gifts from the Freeman family and the encouragement of Mr. Freeman's son, Houghton Freeman. Planned from the start as an educational resource, the ensemble provides a tangible means of experiencing Japanese aesthetics and exploring the cultural values that these spaces embody. The room and garden are actively used for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from meetings of small classes and Japanese tea ceremonies to quiet contemplation and meditation.Shoyoan Teien is an intimately scaled courtyard garden, designed to be viewed from a stationary location.  This garden is akaresansui(dry landscape) garden centering on  a series of abstract forms that allude to features from the local landscape including the Connecticut River and rolling hills of the region.  Stone in the garden was salvaged from nearby brownstone quaries.Shoyoan received a Green Dove Awared from Common Boundary, a Bethesda, Maryland-based organization dedicated to \"exploring psychology, spirituality, and creativity.\" In making the award, Common Boundary said the garden \"stood out for its sheer beauty\" and the way it \"addresses the interface of ecology, psychology, and spirituality by exploring the relationship between humans and our natural environment.\"From the web site:\"The Freeman garden was designed and built in summer 1995 bySteven A. Morrell, a landscape architect specializing in Japanese-style gardens. His earlier public projects have included meditation gardens for Zen Mountain Monastery in Mount Tremper, New York, and Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, New York, as well as a tea garden exhibition for the New York Japan Society. Since 1981, he has been Curator of the John P. Humes Japanese Stroll Garden in Mill Neck, New York.\"Shoyoan Teien falls within the tradition of the viewing garden, one intended primarily for contemplative viewing from within an adjoining roomor from a veranda or bench just outside. Unlike the more expansive strolling garden, which presupposes a moving viewer and sequential experience of shifting views, an intimately scaled courtyard garden like Shoyoan Teienis designed to disclose its full panorama to a stationary visitor seated at its edge. The tradition of the viewing garden has a long history in Japan, attaining its classic formulation in the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century gardens of such Zen monasteries as Ryoanji and Daitokuji in Kyoto.Shoyoan Teien embodies the aesthetic of the \"dry-landscape\" (karesansui),which centers on the use of suggestively laid courses of gravel to evoke a sense of water, flowing through raked patterns of ripples and waves. As is often the case in Japanese gardens, the landscape is not a completely idealized one, but contains a number of forms that alude to prominent featuresof the local environment. Here, the turning course of the raked gravelis meant to evoke the bend in the Connecticut River as it flows through Middletown, while the undulating clusters of Mugo pine on the farther banksuggest the gently rolling hills of the region. Similarly, the stone used in the garden is brownstone, salvaged from the old brownstone quarries across the river in Portland.In 1996, the Freeman garden received the Green Dove Award from Common Boundary, a Bethesda, Maryland-based organization dedicated to \"exploring psychology, sprituality, and creativity.\" In making the award, Common Boundary said the garden \"stood out for its sheer beauty\" and the way it \"addresses the interface of ecology, psychology, and spirituality by exploring therelationship between hymans and our natural environment.\"","Latitude:":41.559571,"Longitude:":-72.657134},{"Name:":"Westin-Nikko Hotel","Alternate Name:":"","Address:":"320 North Dearborn Street","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"Chicago","State:":"Illinois","Postal Code:":"60610-4827","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"744.1900","Fax:":"","E-Mail:":"","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"David Engel","Construction Period:":"-","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"","Admission:":"","Added to JGarden:":"8/1/2001","Last Updated:":"8/1/2001","JGarden Description:":"","Latitude:":41.887744,"Longitude:":-87.629631},{"URL:":"http://jgfneworleans.org/","Name:":"Yakumo Nihon Teien","Alternate Name:":"","Address:":"1 Palm Dr","Mailing Address:":"P.O.

Japanese culture has a special significance to the local Bluegrass community as it is the site of a large Toyot Motor Company manufacturing plant.  The garden was built with donations from many local business and individuals including:  Toyota; the community of sister-city, Tahara-cho; Aichi Steel; Louisville Forge and Gear Works; and local financial institutions.  The entire project cost approximately $1 million.The garden has been built on the former site of a monastery built in 1898 on land acquired from the family of Gov. James F. Robinson.  The new garden was co-designed by Steve Austin, a local landscape architect and lawyer, and Jeff Singer, a local landscape designer and owner of Singer Gardens.The design process was not a conventional North American one.  Austin executed a series of paintings that outlined the vision of what the garden could become and then turned these over to nursery staff and construction workers, who actually did much of the design work as they were constructing the site.  This process is uncommon today, but is an important part of traditional Japanese design and has analogues in European architectural history as well.The originally flat field has been transformed by 600 truckloads of earth into a series of undulating hills that hide, reveal and frame views along the paths that guide visitors through the space.  Singer laid the dry creek bed by hand, placing each piece of gravela nd stone based on his experience as a river kayaking afficianado.  Other design elements include a bridge crossing the dry stream, a pond,tsukiyamapruned shrubs, stone lanterns and akaresansuidry garden.  An unusual addition is a bog garden adjacent to the pond.  The bog acts as a bio-filter for the pond.Planting and construction material are a combination of Japanese and local Kentucky sources.  Flowering red bud trees, join Kentucky canebrake and Bluegrass savanna, bur oaks, blue ash and Kentucky coffee trees.Phase 2 of the garden's design has already begun and will involve the construction of a viewing pavilion at the confluence of the pathways.The garden is located on Elkhorn Creek as part of the grounds of the Cardome Community Center on the west side of U.S. 25 (North Broadway).  The Community Center includes connections to 10 miles of public hiking trails as well as access to the Creek.","Latitude:":38.220921,"Longitude:":-84.565009},{"Name:":"Yushien","Alternate Name:":"Amherst College Japanese Garden","Address:":"SR-9 & S Pleasant St","Mailing Address:":"","City:":"Amherst","State:":"Massachusetts","Postal Code:":"01002","Country:":"UNITED STATES","Phone:":"","Fax:":"","E-Mail:":"","Contact:":"","Designer(s):":"Shinichiro Abe of Zen Associates","Contruction Date:":"2002","Public/Private:":"PUBLIC","Hours:":"","Admission:":"no fee","Added to JGarden:":"6/6/2004","Last Updated:":"6/6/2004","JGarden Description:":"Yushien (meaning 'garden of friendship') was opened on September 23, 2002 to celebrate the strong historical ties between Amherst College and Doshisha University in Kyoto.
